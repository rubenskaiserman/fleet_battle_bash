# Bash Fleet Battle

Fleet battle is a board that consists of you trying to sink your adversaries ship fleet.
You do so by guessing where the ships are positioneds on the board. 
If you guess it right, you may play again. otherwise your oponent will try to shot your fleet.

That all said, this is a simple version of the game runing on bash.

It was my first project ever. So I decided to build it once more just to look how much I've improve my coding skills.
You can check it out if you want. You can use it as mockup for your own game. Anyway, have fun.
